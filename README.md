Zoo Exercise
We are building a zoo inside a computer. Each animal species in our zoo has lots
of different, particular, behaviors, but all animals talk to each other in a similar
way. Specifically, they all implement a ​speak​ method, the output of which is the
arbitrary input string interspersed with an "animal sound" that is particular to that
type of animal. For example, the lion's ​speak​ function behaves like so:

> ​ lion.speak( ​"I'm a lion"​ );
> <​ ​"I'm roar a roar lion roar"
> The tiger's speak function behaves similarly but with a different sound:
> ​ tiger.speak( ​"Lions suck"​ );
> <​ ​"Lions grrr suck grrr"
> Please write logic and classes to support our zoo in JavaScript ​with attention to
> code structure and readability.​
